01 Code Refactor

Objective: 
Front End: To mimick the mockup provided as well as incorporate accessibility standards. 
Back End: Examine the code and uses semantic elements in order to present logical structre and styling. 

Getting statrted I think most amateur developers like myself found many successes as well as fails. The first installion I chose was to delete the div tags and find applicable semantic elements in order to structure the html file for ease of read. This first step teaches to practice patience because deleting one character can change or modify the ending layout. Using and finding resources you need can guide your fails into wins.

Successes: I didn't really have alot of success early with the code. Modifying one tag would always change my layout.
           - Using my resources to find answers instead of getting frustrated with fails

Fails: properly modifying <div tags into semantic elements like <section, <article, <nav, etc.
       - Modifying/mimicking tags in html/css
